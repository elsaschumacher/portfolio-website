      <p>
        I am a third-year Computer Science student at Aalto University. I'm very
        hard working and enthusiastic about the software industry. My minor is
        in Industrial Engineering and Management and I'm excited about the
        intersection of technology and business and how software solutions can
        drive innovation and efficiency in different industries.
